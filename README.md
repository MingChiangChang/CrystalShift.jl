# Crystallography_based_shifting
## TODOs
- [x] Data Structure (7/30)
- [ ] Test cases for optimization
- [ ] Using Optimization API
- [ ] Figure out how to construct residual function with an array of phases
- [ ] Update python script with unit of nm
- [ ] Implement function for q calculation for different crystals

## Development log
### 8/1
* Capable of creating input file with python
* Using crystal and peak info to reconstruct spectrum

### 8/3
* Updated optimize.jl
* Tested peak position
* Start implementing how to calculate residual with spectrum and params
